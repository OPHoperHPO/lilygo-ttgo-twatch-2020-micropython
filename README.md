# :snake: MicroPython for LilyGO TTGO T-Watch-2020 :snake: ![Build firmware](https://github.com/OPHoperHPO/lilygo-ttgo-twatch-2020-micropython/workflows/Build%20firmware/badge.svg)
************************************************************************
## üìÑ Description:
This is a fork of the official version of the micropython v1.13 with **bluetooth support**. \
This micropython fork is **SPECIALLY** sharpened and designed for LilyGO TTGO T-Watch-2020-V1 watches.  \
**Other TTGO watch models are not supported!**

## üî® Build Instructions
### üß∑ WARNING:
Please set `ESPIDF` parameter for the esp-idf install dir. \
It needs to match Micropython expected esp-idf, otherwise a warning will be displayed (and build will probably fail) \
For more details refer to [Setting up the toolchain and ESP-IDF](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_micropython/blob/master/ports/esp32/README.md#setting-up-the-toolchain-and-esp-idf) \
For more details please refer to [Micropython ESP32 README](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/ports/esp32/README.md).
### üè∑ Commands:
1. Install all important libraries via `sudo apt-get install build-essential libreadline-dev libffi-dev git pkg-config libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-dev python`
2. Clone this repo via `git clone https://github.com/OPHoperHPO/lilygo-ttgo-twatch-2020-micropython`
3. Clone all submodules via `git submodule update --init --recursive`
4. Configure esp-idf and toolchain
5. Edit paths to esp-idf and toolchain in `makefile` in `ports/esp32`
6. Build mpy-cross via `make -C mpy-cross`
7. Build micropython and flash it via `make -C ports/esp32 deploy`
